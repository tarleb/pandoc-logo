# Pandoc logo

A logo for the universal document converter.

The reverse paragraph sign ⁋ represents the text structure that pandoc
converts and preserves, with the document icon standing for the output
file.

> [!NOTE]
>
> Pandoc **doesn't** have an official logo. John MacFarlane has never
> approved any logo. The logo here is used for a number of
> pandoc-related projects that benefit from having a logo.
